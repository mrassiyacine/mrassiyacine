Iâ€™m a Junior Data Engineer with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, driven by a strong passion for learning and a relentless motivation to grow in the field of data engineering. With two valuable internships under my belt, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in ETL processes, data infrastructure, and cloud technologies.

Even though I'm graduating in 2024, I prefer reading documentation and using my O'Reilly subscription instead of relying directly on ChatGPT. ðŸ˜„
